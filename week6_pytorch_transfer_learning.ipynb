    "> The images have to be loaded in to a range of `[0, 1]` and then normalized using `mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and `std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`.\n",

However, for our problem, classifying images of pizza, steak and sushi we only need `out_features=3`.*\n",

For example, if your model has pretrained layers, to *freeze* them would be to say, \"don't change any of the patterns in these layers during training, keep them how they are.\" In essence, we'd like to keep the pretrained weights/patterns our model has learned from ImageNet as a backbone and then only change the output layers."

In essence, we're using the `features` portion to feed our `classifier` portion a base representation of an image and then our `classifier` layer is going to learn how to base representation aligns with our problem.\n",
    "* **Less trainable parameters** - Previously there were 5,288,548 trainable parameters. But since we froze many of the layers of the model and only left the `classifier` as trainable, there's now only 3,843 trainable parameters (even less than our TinyVGG model).

Freezing the base layers of our model and leaving it with less trainable parameters means our model should train quite quickly.
